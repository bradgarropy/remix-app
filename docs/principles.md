# Principles

I like to think about these principles while building software.

## Start small

This application is not super full featured. It keeps the complexity and surface area low, and allows users to add what they see fit.

## Minimize services

Use as few services as possible. This helps reduce cost and increases our understanding of the overall system.

## Tests ensure confidence

Test coverage is very high to ensure confidence in the changes we make.
